*What are the pros and cons of TDD?*

One pro of TDD is it brings everyone on the same page and prevents misunderstandings. Another advantage of TDD is it forces you to automate the testing process
instead of manually doing it. Also, it gives you greater confidence when nearing time of deployment of the product since the tests are already created. And since
testing is not rushed anymore, the final product will have better quality. Additionally, TDD fits very well with the Agile Methodology.

One con of TDD is it can create a lot of communication overhead in other methodologies other than Agile. Another disadvantage of TDD is the risk of creating
brittle tests that could break in future changes of the code, or even worse, give false positives.
