**What are the pros and cons of TDD?**

One pro of TDD is it brings everyone on the same page and prevents misunderstandings of what the expectations are. Another advantage of TDD is it forces you to automate the testing process instead of manually doing it, which is a more convenient way. Also, it gives you greater confidence when nearing time of deployment of the product since the tests are already created. And since testing is not rushed, the final product will have better quality and less bugs. Another advantage is it allows developers to confidently make big changes without introducing new problems by re-running all the tests and making sure they pass. Additionally, TDD fits very well with the Agile Methodology because there is no communication required between creating the test and making sure it passes after implementation which saves time.

One con of TDD is it would create a lot of communication overhead in other methodologies other than Agile between creating the test, ensuring it fails, writing the code, and making sure the test passes after, which would worsen the development process. Another disadvantage of TDD is the risk of creating brittle tests that could break in future changes of the code, or even worse, give false positives. Another disadvantage is it requires extra time at the start to write the tests before developers can actually begin writing code.
